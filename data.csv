Love Pork,"A European movement for more taste
The action targets the Danish and Swedish markets for pork. The sector is significantly challenged by low and continuous declining consumption of pork especially amongst young consumers aged 18-29. Increased consumption of pork on the two markets will have a positive impact on the European pig meat industry. Pork is no longer a natural part of the young Scandinavians' diet. They tend to eat less meat in general and to avoid pork in particular. The objective is to increase consumer demand and thereby halt an otherwise forecasted continued decline. By maintaining current levels of penetration and spending, the action will effectively increase penetration with up till 19.7 pct and spending with 30 pct on the target markets. The target group perceives pork as neither trendy nor tasty. To support the objective of increased demand, the action will work to raise the product profile and improve the attractiveness of the product category by means of an innovation seminar for the meat processing industry and retail. The objective is to introduce a total of 40 new pork products or meal concepts in retail for the target group. To reach and convince a complex target group of young consumers, the creative element of the action is to create a consumer movement driven by a group of social media role models with a view to re-establish pork in Northern food and eventually throughout Europe. A primary communication tool will be influencer marketing, and the action will rely on content co-creation on the social media. The action strategy is reflected in the main Union message “Europeans for more taste”. Other key messages on traceability, food safety and responsible consumption support the main Union message and promote the high quality of the product and position pork as delicate and tasty. The total budget for the proposed action is EUR 3,185,525. The estimated return on investment ratio of the action is 7.65.",Denmark;Sweden,2451165.76;97254.40,2548420.16,https://ec.europa.eu/chafea/agri/en/campaigns/love-pork
ASSOLATTEMI,"The program “The shapes of milk, discover the quality made in EU” is presented by Assolatte - Associazione Italiana Lattiero Casearia, which is the national body responsible for Italian industries operating in the dairy sector. The 2-years proposal aims to increase the awareness of the merits of Union agricultural products and the high standards applicable to the EU production methods in Italy and in Belgium and to increase the competitiveness and consumption of EU drinking milk. 
Despite the fact that the internal market remains the main outlet for EU milk production and that milk remains a staple in both Italian and Belgian shopping baskets, this campaign is all the more necessary in view of the constant decline in milk consumption, due to the change in dietary choices. In line with the provisions of the AWP 2019, the objective is to highlight EU drinking milk, particulary in terms of quality and nutritional aspects, to the European consumers. 
The action strategy has been structured to achieve the target groups identified: millenials/gen.X (through digital activities and sensorial and innovative exhibitions, will leverage on the needs and preconceptions of the consumers, to make them rethink the product, to rediscover its essence through an exhibition/event with a strong emotional value and videomapping),  media/blogger/influencer (through PR, training courses, journalist award, press conference, vernissage, gala events, collaboration with bloggers, press tour) and nutrition professionals (through one-to-one relationships, specific information seminar, training course and award).",Italy,700606.9,700606.9,https://ec.europa.eu/chafea/agri/en/campaigns/assolattemi
EU LAMB CAMPAIGN,"Over 80% of sheep production in the EU is produced in rugged rural areas where no other species can be reared on a commercial scale. Hence, sheep farming plays a vital role from a social, environmental and economic sustainability perspective in these regions. However, given the continued decline in lamb consumption and consequently production in Europe, and the numerous factors and consequences highlighted by the 2016 EU Sheep Meat Reflection Group, it is urgent that we act now to protect this unique sustainable heritage of Europe.


France, Ireland and the UK, under the auspices of Interbev, Bord Bia and AHDB, have joined forces to request EU co-funding for a new €10 million promotional campaign over 3 years aiming to convince millennial consumers (aged 25-35) across four EU markets (France, Ireland, Germany and the UK) to ""Love Lamb"", by inciting them to discover the convenience and unique flavour of European lamb. Today lamb is primarily consumed by consumers over 50 years old across these markets, and it is vital to appeal to and convert younger consumers thereby supporting the future of this livelihood in Europe.


The campaign's objective is to reach out to this digitally native audience using the appropriate tone of voice and references via their preferred media, in order to convince them to consider lamb as a unique everyday protein choice. This young target audience is proportionately more motivated by sustainability issues than their elders, hence the sustainability credentials of European lamb will also be at the forefront of this campaign. We propose a range of central actions which will be developed and implemented across the four markets to ensure a greater impact and greater economies of scale. These include PR, digital marketing (common website, social media platforms and various forms of online advertising), event marketing and trade marketing actions in specific markets. All of the campaign collateral will be translated and tested before execution.

Carne de Conejo,"INTERCUN and ASPOC, two state-recognised organizations of Spain and Portugal, present a Multi Topic C 3-year programme that highlights the high quality standards of the EU and aspires to establish a new milestone in Europe regarding the situation of rabbit meat, a sector that has not been previously financed. Given that Spain is the second producer of rabbit meat in the EU, the program will be coordinated by Spain and will benefit the entire sector across the EU by responding to 3 common issues: 1) The global decline in rabbit meat production. 2) Dramatic fall in consumption of rabbit meat. 3) No value recognized for the European product.  It is important to inform the public about the production methods in the EU and the distinctive features of European rabbit meat in order to differentiate our production.


 The campaign focuses on consumers and professionals (butchers and HORECA) as well as communication media. It will be developed using a global European message as well as specific adaptation for each target audience and market. The campaign will implement 360-degree marketing activities with reinforced PR actions, significant online activities and social media actions, webinars, advertising via TV and conventional media, digital media, Facebook ads and cinema advertising. In addition, targeted material will be provided to retailers and POS and for use at training activities in Cooking Schools and professional workshops (butchers).


The goal is to achieve an effective program that will reactivate rabbit meat consumption and will allow new consumers to add value and maintain the European production model at sustainable levels for the future. It will allow an increase in consumption of 0.03kg/capita per annum and an increase in sales of more than 5M kg of rabbit meat and €32 million. With a very positive ROI and campaign outreach of more than 581 million contacts, we expect to generate a change in perception that will reach 10% of our target.


The financing and coordination of the project are guaranteed. Initially presented in 2016 and considerably improved in its latest submission, the programme aspires to be approved and financed, given the serious situation affecting the sector.

CARNES CON ESTILO,"The Ternera Gallega and Ternasco de Aragón PGIs are the most common in beef and suckling lamb production and commercialisation in Spain, and they are joining forces to request aid from the EU to raise the level of knowledge and recognition of the Union's quality regimes, specifically about the PGI quality stamp which is very little known in Europe and Spain. They are both confronted with the added complexity of competing in a market against other meats, which have no differentiating quality stamp and which are available at a lower price. Additionally, their market is in decline as consumption of their categories has fallen dramatically in recent years. The great asset of the two PGI products is their EU certified quality. According to market research, the Spanish consumer is becoming more demanding in matters of food and values superior quality, being inclined to pay more for food whenever greater quality is identified.
This has enabled a communications strategy for the campaign to be determined, through a message that is highly visual, simple, approachable, easily understood and, above all, grabs one's attention and conveys the superior quality of PGI products. The message we will use alongside the PGI stamp is: 'Meat with style - either you have it or you don't'. This will convey that it is the PGI stamp which gives you style and is synonymous with high quality. After all, both PGIs have a unique way of protecting the quality of their product, a specific way of rearing, feeding and slaughtering their animals, a sustainable method which supports rural economy. We will make contact with our target through initiatives that ensure coverage and affinity and we will gain visibility through POS initiatives, as the great majority of purchasing decisions are taken at the POS here in Spain. As a result, we will increase competitiveness and consumption of these Union PGI products.

EUROPEAN VEAL MEAT,"Promotional campaign for European veal meat in the Belgian, French and Italian markets 2019/2020/2021
Veal production and consumption are specifically European phenomena: beyond the borders of Europe, the veal market is practically or completely non-existent. Veal meat is popular because it is tender, light and full of flavour. It is part of Europe's gastronomic heritage, and traditional veal dishes are stalwarts of the food culture in certain countries. However, the veal market has been declining since the 2000s. There are various reasons for this: the economic crisis, changes in consumption behaviour and above all a lack of top-of-mind awareness. France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy are minded to fight this fall in consumption by boosting the image consumers have of European veal. To achieve this, the four main veal-producing countries are working together to present an application for €5,9m of European co-funding to run a promotional campaign in France, Belgium and Italy (where almost 70% of Europe's veal is consumed). The overall objective of this campaign will be to boost consumption (+0,5% versus 2017) using a strategy designed to make veal more visible within the main purchase locations and increase awareness of the way European veal is farmed. The approach used will concentrate on point-of-sale activities (with regular actions to promote the product in-store), supported by a media relations and advertising campaign which is essential to boosting the image of the product and communicating the high quality of this meat which is so prominent in Europe’s gastronomic heritage. It is in effect crucially important that this campaign has a positive impact: European veal production plays a concrete role in maintaining almost 25,000 jobs, and generates revenue of €5.8bn. It also helps keep the European beef sector viable by providing a vital source of regulation. But above all, it is inextricably linked with the dairy industry. It offers a way of deriving value from young male calves, and also consumes dairy raw materials in calf feed.",France;Italy;Netherlands;Belgium,2957489.00;836998.00;1156247.00;1044741.00,5995475,https://ec.europa.eu/chafea/agri/en/campaigns/european-veal-meat
Pork lovers Europe,"""The consumption of pork meat in Europe has decreased in recent years. In the EU-27 in 2008, we had consumption per capita of 41.7kg. In 2015, this number fell to 40.9kg. Therefore, it is very important to promote pork meat to restore the confidence of the consumer, which was shaken by news such as the last IARC report. Our project will focus on Spain, United Kingdom (UK), Germany, France and Portugal. The choice of the aforementioned countries is based on the following data: a very low level of pork meat consumption in the UK, which is 24.5kg per capita. A sharp decrease in consumption in Germany, from 55.2kg in 2008 to 53.1kg in 2015. In Spain, consumption decreased from 56.2kg in 2008 to 50.6kg in 2013, with a recovery in 2015 to 54.4kg, thanks to an internal promotion campaign, led by Interporc. For Portugal, the inclusion is based on the geographic proximity to Spain. The campaign will be based on the theme “Pork Lovers”, in order to publicise the properties of pork meat, on a nutritional level, the production methodology, based on animal welfare, environment protection, traceability and free of growing factors. To achieve our goals, the campaign will be based on a Road Show in Spain and the UK, as well as participation in specialised fairs and events, such as Anuga in Cologne, SIAL in Paris and Alimentaria in Lisbon. The campaign will be based on the Pork Lovers Road Show. We will organise press conferences, cooking workshops for students of hotel and courses for restaurant professionals, visits from the retailers, workshops for refined restaurants, culinary meetings for gastronomy lovers, playful ateliers for children, visits from government officials and visits from consumers. We will also hand over some gifts, such as Pork Lovers masks for children, bags for house wives, USB pens for the press and promote the events on the Facebook platform. The total budget for this proposal is €1,951,260""",Spain,1366348.2,1366348.2,https://ec.europa.eu/chafea/agri/campaigns/pork-lovers-europe
EMF Milk,"A European multi-programme on milk targeting the internal markets in Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland and the Netherlands

The highest standards in terms of food safety, authenticity, quality and taste. Milk is popular and affordable, appreciated by European consumers and deeply anchored in food habits in each of the participating countries. The dairy sector is a major economic actor in Europe with thousands of milk producers and many companies generating thousands of jobs. However, the milk market is today facing a lasting crisis due to a continuing decrease in milk consumption and a deterioration of its image in public opinion.
In order to enhance the competitiveness of European agriculture, the objectives for this action are to reverse the trend by stopping the decrease of consumption of milk and to restore its image by helping consumers to reconnect with milk and spoonable milk products.
The 5 countries are geographically close to each other, but they do not drink milk the same way. The strategy is based on a common approach shared by the 5 countries. The action targets families with young children and young millennial adults pre-children, with a core target aged 20-35 years old, who are a market to win back and who will eventually pass on their eating habits to their children. It includes a set of cost-effective activities designed to reach the target groups: PR and e-PR such as blogger & influencer events, image bank, social media accounts, experiential events and event sponsoring, production of videos and advertising on various platforms. We want to help people rediscover the pleasure of using milk, a tasty and versatile product, focusing on the emotional as well as the rational.

PROUD OF EU BEEF,"The objective of Proud of European Beef is to showcase  a project which gathers two beef meat organisations: PROVACUNO in Spain and APAQ-W in Belgium for a 3-year programme.
These two organisations have launched a comprehensive and easy-to-implement campaign, based on a diverse programme of activities covering its whole range of targets: consumers, journalists, trade and Horeca sector, all of them with synergic activities for the 5 targeted markets: Spain, France, Portugal, Germany and Belgium.
Over the last decade throughout Europe the fresh meat consumption has faced constat decrease. 
The aim of this campaign is to incite the consumers not to have a stereotyped idea about red meat and to enable them to be again confident about their consumption decision.
The scope of the project is not only to highlighting the benefits of the product but to make the consumer feel identified and supported in its choice regarding it. Consumer behaviour may lead to a refusal to eat meat due to the multiple types of information presented nowadays, but even so those consumers who choose to eat red meat should feel at ease should they wish to reaffirm their choice for this product.",Spain;Belgium,2406032.78;1199237.94,3605270.72,https://ec.europa.eu/chafea/agri/en/campaigns/proud-eu-beef
LetsTalkAboutPork,"Pork is the most consumed meat in all Europe. Despite that, its consumption decreased, which is the midpoint for all stakeholders in the industry. The factors that led to this decrease are several but mainly relate to controversies on the sustainability of pork meat and animal welfare. The project aims to inform the consumer about the reality of production in the entire pork chain. Its goal is to demystify the various information that has been targeting the sector, by showing the conditions of production in the farms with scrupulous respect for the highest standards of animal welfare, and then proving the sustainability of the production process and how it contributes to nitrogen fixation in the soil. Together with this, other points concern the conditions of well-being and hygiene of slaughterhouses and the dissemination of traceability systems throughout the entire production chain that gives the total guarantee for the consumer who has at his disposal a meat that respects all food safety standards. Consumer habits differ from country to country, but this will be the message spread throughout all the countries covered by this application, and will lead to specific actions in each country. The slogan of the campaign will be ""let’s talk about pork"", which will target young people up to 35 years old. This campaign will  be based on true and false messages that will sparkle interest among the young people about the reality of the pork line.",Spain;France;Portugal;Portugal,2451428.64;2428053.20;587983.72,5467465.56,https://ec.europa.eu/chafea/agri/en/campaigns/letstalkaboutpork
