The sector is significantly challenged by low and continuous declining consumption of pork especially amongst young consumers aged 18-29. Increased consumption of pork on the two markets will have a positive impact on the European pig meat industry. Pork is no longer a natural part of the young Scandinavians' diet. They tend to eat less meat in general and to avoid pork in particular. The objective is to increase consumer demand and thereby halt an otherwise forecasted continued decline. By maintaining current levels of penetration and spending, the action will effectively increase penetration with up till 19.7 pct and spending with 30 pct on the target markets. The target group perceives pork as neither trendy nor tasty. To support the objective of increased demand, the action will work to raise the product profile and improve the attractiveness of the product category by means of an innovation seminar for the meat processing industry and retail. The objective is to introduce a total of 40 new pork products or meal concepts in retail for the target group. To reach and convince a complex target group of young consumers, the creative element of the action is to create a consumer movement driven by a group of social media role models with a view to re-establish pork in Northern food and eventually throughout Europe. A primary communication tool will be influencer marketing, and the action will rely on content co-creation on the social media. The action strategy is reflected in the main Union message \\u201cEuropeans for more taste\\u201d. Other key messages on traceability, food safety and responsible consumption support the main Union message and promote the high quality of the product and position pork as delicate and tasty.

Additionally, their market is in decline as consumption of their categories has fallen dramatically in recent years. The great asset of the two PGI products is their EU certified quality. According to market research, the Spanish consumer is becoming more demanding in matters of food and values superior quality, being inclined to pay more for food whenever greater quality is identified.\\nThis has enabled a communications strategy for the campaign to be determined, through a message that is highly visual, simple, approachable, easily understood and, above all, grabs one's attention and conveys the superior quality of PGI products. The message we will use alongside the PGI stamp is: 'Meat with style - either you have it or you don't'. This will convey that it is the PGI stamp which gives you style and is synonymous with high quality. After all, both PGIs have a unique way of protecting the quality of their product, a specific way of rearing, feeding and slaughtering their animals, a sustainable method which supports rural economy.

Veal meat is popular because it is tender, light and full of flavour. It is part of Europe's gastronomic heritage, and traditional veal dishes are stalwarts of the food culture in certain countries. However, the veal market has been declining since the 2000s. There are various reasons for this: the economic crisis, changes in consumption behaviour and above all a lack of top-of-mind awareness.

To achieve this, the four main veal-producing countries are working together to present an application for \\u20ac5,9m of European co-funding to run a promotional campaign in France, Belgium and Italy (where almost 70% of Europe's veal is consumed). The overall objective of this campaign will be to boost consumption (+0,5% versus 2017) using a strategy designed to make veal more visible within the main purchase locations and increase awareness of the way European veal is farmed.

Therefore, it is very important to promote pork meat to restore the confidence of the consumer, which was shaken by news such as the last IARC report. Our project will focus on Spain, United Kingdom (UK), Germany, France and Portugal. The choice of the aforementioned countries is based on the following data: a very low level of pork meat consumption in the UK, which is 24.5kg per capita. A sharp decrease in consumption in Germany, from 55.2kg in 2008 to 53.1kg in 2015. In Spain, consumption decreased from 56.2kg in 2008 to 50.6kg in 2013, with a recovery in 2015 to 54.4kg, thanks to an internal promotion campaign, led by Interporc.
